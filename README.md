# PyDL - Python AHP Graph
In order to use PyDL you will need to add to the python path so
that the files can be located

put something like the following in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile:
```Bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path to where you downloaded PyDL>
```
don't include /PyDL at the end, so that you can in Python do
```Python
from PyDL import *
```
### Ubuntu apt packages:
```Bash
apt install graphviz libgraphviz-dev
```
### Python3 packages:
```Bash
python3 -m pip install pygraphviz orjson
```

## Useful Tips
- Besides graph construction, the main features that PyDL provides are several outputs
  - DeviceGraph.build_sst() will immediately turn your graph into SST components and begin a simulation
  - DeviceGraph.write_json() will output the graph along with parameters in JSON format
  - DeviceGraph.write_dot() will output the graph in DOT format and optionally draw SVGs with them
- All output generated by PyDL goes into a folder called 'output'
  - This is for the DeviceGraph.write_json() and DeviceGraph.write_dot() functions
- SST global parameters are set by adding things to the DeviceGraph attr field
- SST component parameters are set by adding things to the Device attr field
- You can still do normal SST Python things (examples below):
  - sst.setProgramOption()
  - sst.setStatisticLoadLevel()
  - sst.setStatisticOutput()
- DeviceGraph.build_sst() returns a dictionary of devices with their name as the key
  - You can use this to enable statistics for devices after they are created
- If you plan to build the graph with PyDL partitioning and run with MPI, remember to include the '--parallel-load=SINGLE' flag to sst
  - '--parallel-load' by default will work with multiple unique files
  - PyDL can generate the graph for each rank using a single file, so it needs the value 'SINGLE'
- By default sst grabs all command line parameters
  - You can pass parameters to the python script by putting '-- ' before your script parameters
